The HidaV Platform Project
--------------------------

This project does OpenEmbedded platform integration and optimization for the HidaV platform.

HidaV is a robust, low power, embedded storage platform based on Texas Instruments' DM8148 Cortex A8 ARM CPU. It will be available from DResearch Fahrzeugelektronik GmbH when it's done.

For documentation on HidaV please have a look at our GitHub Wiki https://github.com/DFE/HidaV/wiki. If you're interested in HidaV development just come over and say hello on our mailing list (<https://groups.google.com/a/dresearch-fe.de/group/hidav-devel-list/topics>).
