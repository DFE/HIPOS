The HidaV Platform Project
==========================

This project does OpenEmbedded platform integration and optimization
for the HidaV platform.

HidaV is a robust, low power, embedded storage platform currently supporting
Texas Instruments' DM8148 Cortex A8 CPU. The [Layer Architecture](https://github.com/DFE/HidaV/wiki/Hidav-oe-layers),
however, enables for BSP support of arbitrary hardware platforms.

HidaV provides development support, application lifecycle management, and a 
plethora of libraries and applications for this platform in a state of the 
art Linux system based on OpenEmbedded. Devices will be available from 
DResearch Fahrzeugelektronik GmbH at some point in the future.

For documentation on HidaV please have a look at our
[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/DFE/HidaV/wiki). If you're interested in
HidaV development just come over and say hello on our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dresearch-fe.de/group/hidav-devel-list/topics).
