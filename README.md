The HidaV Platform Project
==========================

This project does OpenEmbedded platform integration and optimization
for the HidaV platform.

HidaV is a robust, low power, embedded storage platform. We're currently
investigating Texas Instruments' DM8148 Cortex A8 and Marvel Kirkwood 
88F628x CPUs for building the hardware platform. 

HidaV provides development support, application lifecycle management, and a 
plethora of libraries and applications for this platform in a state of the 
art Linux system based on OpenEmbedded. Devices will be available from 
DResearch Fahrzeugelektronik GmbH at some point in the future.

For documentation on HidaV please have a look at our
[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/DFE/HidaV/wiki). If you're interested in
HidaV development just come over and say hello on our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dresearch-fe.de/group/hidav-devel-list/topics).
